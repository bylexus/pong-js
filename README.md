> A small PONG<sup>TM</sup> experiment in EcmaScript 6 and HTML5 canvas.

This is a very small experiment for myself. I just wanted to play with canvas, animations, some ECMA Script 6.
The result is a In-Browser PONG game, which can be played by 2 players ON THE SAME KEYBOARD, which turned out to be
really funny.


How to play
------------

Find the game <a href="https://alexi.ch/pong/">online</a>, then play:

* Player 1: UP: 'a', DOWN: 'y'
* Player 2: UP: 'k', DOWN: 'm'
* Pause / Run: SPACE

A Screen:

Develop

### debug

* npm install
* gulp build / gulp watch

### prod

* npm install
* gulp build:prod
* gulp export # --> creates a prod build version in ./export/

Disclaimer
----------

Don't blame me for any errors, addictions or broken fingers. This game was made just for fun, so play and enjoy!
Let me know if you did so.
